1776816-The Royal Wedding Song:::All of the girls around the world are saying the same thing.I should - I should be the one to marry prince charming.Now if this won't effect you then know we're the same.But listen up - I made a song in which I'll try to explain (check it out)..Every little girl has the same exact dream.A pretty white dress and a (gasp) diamond ring.To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell..To be the princess in his fairy tale.Why is she the one that gets the fairy tale?.This might make you laugh but its not a spoof.Everything I raps 100% truth.When a royal wedding happens... here's your proof.Twinky sales go through the rough.And the sorority girls all get excited.But so much jealously... its hard to hide it.All over the news and hurts to look.So one by one they tweet & face book.Saying (uhh) such an issue.I know girlfriend - pass me the tissues.The boys I know all lack in sense.And there she goes just... found a prince!."real life princess" must be nice.That should be me... it's just not right.It looks so sweet but it feels like a knife.Well she's gonna have a perfect life.Every little girl has the same exact dream.A pretty dress and a (gasp) diamond ring.To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell..To be the princess in his fairy tale.Why is she the one that gets the fairy tale?.Now the hardest part is the honey moon.More pictures then they can consume.So the first 3 days they just stay in their rooms.Back and forth - vent and fume and.I don't really care... cause it's not my life.But I mean... they ARE missing paradise.So if you're a guy.... take my advise.The best thing to do is just keep quiet.Don't even try it... crackin' joke.Girls world wide just trying to cope.See they had this dream... and they just lost hope.Save yourselves... let 'em mope.Cause things might seem cool... but there's major problems..Girly stuff.... trust we can't solve 'em.Soon as they showed her in that tiara.KNOW they ALL hit rock bottom.Before I watch anymore... I'm going to need my diet coke and a tube of cookie dough!..Every little girl has the same exact dream.A pretty dress and a (gasp) diamond ring.To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell..To be the princess in his fairy tale.Every little girl has the same exact dream.A pretty dress and a (gasp) diamond ring.To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell..To be the princess in his fairy tale.Not to worry ladies... I'm available ;)..

29592100-Break Up in a Small Town:::.I knew I'd see her around.I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out.Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister.I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me.In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back.I'd act like I didn't see her.We'd pay at the same pumps.Flip through the same stations.And slow down for the same curves.Run around with the same crowds.We just needed some time.She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine.Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not.I knew she'd find a way to get over me.But I'd never thought that.......she would get down with somebody I know.I guess that's just how it goes.When you break up in a small town.I see our friends and they put on a show.Like they don't want me to know.So they give me the go-around.But there's only so many streets, so many lights.I swear it's like I can't even leave my house.I should've known all along.You gotta move or move on.When you break up in a small town.For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key.But now it's like these county lines closing in on me.I see 'em everywhere together.And it's hitting a little too close to home.She's so far gone, she just didn't go far.She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car.She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard.In someone else's arms right down the road.And I never thought that.......she would get down with somebody I know.I guess that's just how it goes.When you break up in a small town.I see our friends and they put on a show.Like they don't want me to know.So they give me the go-around.But there's only so many streets, so many lights.I swear it's like I can't even leave my house.I should've known all along.You gotta move or move on.When you break up in a small town.Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine.And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him.And I wanna jump out.I wanna fight.I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't.It's my fault, I let her go.I never thought that.......she would get down with somebody I know.I guess that's just how it goes.When you break up in a small town.I see our friends and they put on a show.Like they don't want me to know.So they give me the go-around.But there's only so many streets, so many lights.I swear it's like I can't even leave my house.I should've known all along.You gotta move or move on.When you break up in a small town..

451520995-Ghost Of You:::.....I've been a liar and a lover.I've been the focus of the conflict.I've been trying to recover.What's the meaning to this nonsense.Oh lord, show me there's so much more to this life than the road I've been.Like I started back at the beginning, right before the final inning when the **** will all this pain just end.I've been dying while trying to get away from you knowing the motivation inside of me has overtaken you.I started off a loser its hard to shake off the feeling.Without you here by my side I really don't how I'm dealing.I tried to guide you through but I need my co-pilot.Figured that it'd be easy and breezy so I just tried it.And solo here with my do lo I'm facing every decision.Like really what does it matter it isn't making a difference so.Late in the night when the moons outside and the sun goes down.The mood in the air will remind me of how we would paint this town.I try to replace what I had with you.Thats what I think I'm supposed to do.But the voice in my head only haunts me instead I'm convinced it's the ghost of you.Tell me what I should do.Tell me where I'm supposed to be.Cause even if it's good for you.Doesn't mean that it was good for me.No one wants to feel unwanted.Hard to break from the ones you bond with.Here alone this house has become haunted.What can I do to get away from the ghost of you.I've been up all night by the window.Heartbeat steady rocking to the tempo.Reading articles and trying to find some info.Everything it points to you.I don't want to leave you there in the background.Livid and afraid and alone.But the way that I'm haunted by you lately.Has got me faded in the twilight zone.So I had to visit your grave plot with the hope that the pain stops.And say goodbye to what we had I couldn't and came out.Worse than how I started and broke down and tears.Crazy how much I miss you it's been so many years.Friends they interfere while wondering what's the matter.Shattered by what has happened and talking just makes me madder.I couldn't ever explain the feeling that's in brain.even though I'm to blame and nothing will be the same now.
2786189-Sunny Day:::I open my eyes.I look to the sky.it's a sunny day.the world is looking so bright.what a surprise.it's a sunny day.oh oh oh oh oh ohooo.Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme what I want.I want sunshine sunshine.Gimme Gimme Gimme cuz it's been so long.I want sunshine sunshine.I'm feeling so free.like a summer breeze.It must be magic.I forget all my plans.put my toes in the sand.I just can't help it.oh oh ooh oh ohhh.Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme what I want.I want sunshine sunshine.Gimme Gimme Gimme cuz it's been so long.I want sunshine sunshine.we're two of a kind.like blue birds singing out a simple tune.if you don't mind.it's the perfect kind of day to fall in love.with you.oh oh ooh oh ohhh.Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme what I want.I want sunshine sunshine.Gimme Gimme Gimme cuz it's been so long.I want sunshine sunshine.oh oh ooh oh ohhh.
473742953-Heavy (Nicky Romero Remix):::.I don’t like my mind right now.Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary.Wish that I could slow things down.I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic.And I drive myself crazy.Thinking everything's about me.Yeah, I drive myself crazy.'Cause I can’t escape the gravity..I'm holding on.Why is everything so heavy?.Holding on.So much more than I can carry.I keep dragging around what's bringing me down.If I just let go, I'd be set free.Holding on.Why is everything so heavy?..Holding, Holding-ding(xN)..You say that I'm paranoid.But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me.It’s not like I make the choice.To let my mind stay so ****ing messy.I know I'm not the center of the universe.But you keep spinning 'round me just the same.I know I'm not the center of the universe.But you keep spinning 'round me just the same..I'm holding on.Why is everything so heavy?.Holding on.So much more than I can carry.I keep dragging around what's bringing me down.If I just let go, I'd be set free.Holding on.Why is everything so heavy?..Holding, Holding-ding(xN).Holding on.Holding, Holding-ding.Holding on.Holding, Holding-ding..I know I'm not the center of the universe.But you keep spinning 'round me just the same.I know I'm not the center of the universe.But you keep spinning 'round me just the same.And I drive myself crazy.Thinking everything’s about me..Holding on.Why is everything so heavy?.Holding on.So much more than I can carry.I keep dragging around what's bringing me down.I just let go, I'd be set free.Holding on.Why is everything so heavy?.Why is everything so heavy?.
470687490-Galway Girl (Martin Jensen Remix):::..... I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar.She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar.She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?.Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?.She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun.She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun.Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar.Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance..You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band.But she fell in love with an English man.Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.Said, "baby, I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance with my pretty little Galway girl".You are my pretty little Galway girl.Galway girl.You are my pretty little Galway girl..You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool.And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room.As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool.After dancing to Kaleigh,singing to trad tunes.I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet.A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat.Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week.And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me..You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band.But she fell in love with an English man.Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.Said, "baby,I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance with my pretty little Galway girl".You are my pretty little Galway girl.Galway girl.You are my pretty little Galway girl..And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time.I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine.Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine.As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night.I walked her home then she took me inside.To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine.I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write.About a Galway girl and a perfect night..She played the fiddle in an Irish band.But she fell in love with an English man.Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.Said, "baby, I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance"."I just wanna dance with my pretty little Galway girl".My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl.My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl.My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl, hey.Galway girl.

36586298-Twenty Something (Lucian Remix):::.I’m twenty-one but I never had a clue.I’m hanging here just to try and play it cool.Ran out of time I can barely make it through.Booze down my throat I see waves of changing hues.The smoking sky gathered streams of flowing stars.The glim of light travelled miles and miles afar.Into our eyes they discovered where we are.We’ll never know cause we’re million years apart.Drown in ripples of pounding sea.Trapped and choking in my nicotine.Cause I’m losing all my sanity.Override my memories.I can’t take this new reality.I can’t feel my own gravity.I’m still looking for my clarity.Deep inside my memories.I’m twenty-one but I never had a clue.I’m twenty-one but I never had a clue.You said you’re chained to the city’s vicious pace.The more you give only means the more they take.So you decided not to wake up everyday.Here comes a storm you’re just gonna let it rain.My skull is cracking I can’t read another page.You turned around seeing nothing else is saved.Bury your senses you can’t feel it anyways.Then turn your cheek when they slap you on the face.Drown in ripples of pounding sea.Trapped and choking in my nicotine.Cause I’m losing all my sanity.Override my memories.I can’t take this new reality.I can’t feel my own gravity.I’m still looking for my clarity.Deep inside my memories.I’m twenty-one but I never had a clue.I’m twenty-one but I never had a clue.

29423160-Ontario Gothic:::.....I was trapped under concrete.Built from the memory.Of all the daydreams.That I buried underneath.Now find me a way to divide.All of the noise on the other side.We'll change where we live in the fall.Soon it will feel like nothing is wrong.And I could see who I should be.Through a past that casts it shadow down over me.In empty fields on summer nights.I feel the flashing lights..Teeth clenched in moonlight.A limitation, want to ignite.Reset my biology.The imitation, the apology.And I felt just like a child.I'm taking it all from the other side.Driving with you in your car.The home that I know seems so far..Spring, fall I've lost it all.Your empty street where we would meet.Spring, fall The morning fog.Your empty street where we would meet.These parking lots bless us with peace.Your light has strayed, there's no release..Spring, fall I've lost it all.Your empty street where we would meet.These parking lots bless us with peace.Your light has strayed, there's no release..
31460066-At The Table:::.I went the ways of wayward winds.In a world of trouble and sin.Walked along a crooked mile.Behind a million rank and file.Forgot where I came from.Somewhere back when I was young.I was a good man’s child..‘Cause I lost some nameless things.My innocence flew away from me.She had to hide her face from my desireto embrace forbidden fire.But at night I dreamedshe’s singing over me.Oh oh my child.Come on home.Home to me.And I will hold you in my arms.And joyful be.There will always.Always be.A place for you at my table.Return to me..Wondering where I might begin.I hear a voice upon the wind.She's singing faint but singing true."Son, there ain't nothing you can do.But listen close and follow me.I'll take you where you’re meant to be.Just don't lose faith."..So I put my hand upon the plow.Wipe the sweat up from my brow.Plant the good seed along the way.As I look forward to the day.When at last I'll see.My father run to me.Singing, “Oh, my child.".Come on home.Home to me.And I will hold you in my arms.And joyful be.There will always, always be.A place for you.At my table.Return to me..Come on home.Home to me.And I will hold you in my arms.And joyful be.There will always, always be.A place for you at my table.....Return to me..

Wake up straight.Caught out by the sun.On the first day of April.Out of bed.Thought it was a plane crash.But I'm sure that I was dreaming.Tv on.Of course caffeine.A science of submission again.Another day.On this little island.Just a bell hangs on.Porridge done.I take my kid to school.Pased the pound shop, Woolworth's.Under bridge.Where the subway sees the daytime.And the Westway flies by.Then on my bike.Down the Ladbroke Grove.To the forthcoming dramas.A studio.And a love of all sweet music.We just can't let go.Let go, let go, let go, let go.So meditate.On what we've all become.On a cold day in springtime.Civil war.Is what we were all born into.Raise your left hand, right, sing.Don't capitulate to the forces.Of the market place.They've long departed.Consolidate.The love we have together.On a cold day in springtime.

Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind. I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99. I've understood that you will never be mine. And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside..

And force them to meet face to face. And one day, he'll look into her eyes. And say that "You're my only light".. Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind. I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99. Maybe there's a chance that you will be mine. But right now, I'm just broken inside..

Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track. We'll get taken for a ride. By a parlor trick or some words of wit. A hidden hand up a sleeve. To think the one you love. could hurt you now. Is a little hard to believe. But everybody darlin' sometimes. Bites the hand that feeds. When I look around. Everybody always brings me down. Well is it them or me. Well I just can't see. But there ain't no peace to found. But if someone really cared. Well they'd take the time to spare. A moment to try and understand. Another one's despair. Remember in this game we call life. That no one said it's fair. BREAKDOWN. BREAKDOWN. Let me hear it now. BREAKDOWN. let me hear it now. Yeah. BREAKDOWN. Let me hear it now. BREAKDOWN. let me hear it now. Get down with yo' bad self. Alright. I've come to know the cold. I think of it as home. When there ain't enough of me. To go around. I'd rather be left alone. But if I call you out of habit. I'm out of love and I gotta have it. Would you give it to me. If I fit you needs. Like when we both knew we had it. But now the damage's done. And we're back out on the run. Fun how ev'rything was Roses. When we held on to the Guns. Just because you're winnin'. Don't mean you're the lucky ones. BREAKDOWN. Let me hear it now. BREAKDOWN. Yeah. BREAKDOWN. BREAKDOWN. let me hear it now. "There goes the challenger being chased. By the blue blue meanies on wheels. The vicious traffic squad cars are. After our lone driver. The last American hero. The-the electric sintar. The demi-god,. The super driver of the golden west!.

26289230-The Last Resort::: She came from Providence.The one in Rhode Island.Where the old world shadows hang.Heavy in the air.She packed her hopes and dreams.Like a refugee.Just as her father came across the sea.She heard about a place people were smiling.They spoke about the red man's way.And how they loved the land.And they came from everywhere.To the Great Divide.Seeking a place to stand.Or a place to hide.Down in the crowded bars.Out for a good time.Can't wait to tell you all.What it's like up there.And they called it paradise.I don't know why.Somebody laid the mountains low.While the town got high.Then the chilly winds blew down.Across the desert.Through the canyons of the coast,.To the Malibu.Where the pretty people play,.Hungry for power.To light their neon way.And give them things to do.Some rich men came and raped the land,.Nobody caught them.Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus,.People bought them.And they called it paradise.The place to be.They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea.You can leave it all behind.And sail to Lahaina.Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago.They even brought a neon sign:"Jesus is coming".Brought the white man's burden down.Brought the white man's reign.Who will provide the grand design?.What is yours and what is mine?.Cause there is no more new frontier.We have got to make it here.We satifsy our endless needs.And justify our bloody deeds,.In the name of destiny.And the name of God.And you can see them there,.On Sunday morning.Stand up and sing about.What it's like up there.They call it paradise.I don't know why.You call someplace paradise,.Kiss it goodbye.

17678527-Waiting In The Weeds::: It's comin' on the end of August.Another summer's promise almost gone.And though I heard some wise man say.That every dog will have his day.He never mentioned that these dog days get so long..I don't know when I realized the dream was over.Well, there was no particular hour, no given day.You know, it didn't go down in flame.There was no final scene, no frozen frame.I just watched it slowly fade away..And I've been waiting in the weeds.Waiting for my time to come around again and.Hope is floating on the breeze.Carrying my soul high up above the ground and.I've been keeping to myself.Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing you.And though you're with somebody else.He'll never love you like I do..I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows.While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage.If finding love is just a dance.Proximity and chance.You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade..And I've been waiting in the weeds.Waiting for the dust to settle down along the.Back roads running through the fields.Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town.And I imagine sunlight in your hair.You're at the county fair.You're holding hands and laughing.And now the ferris wheel has stopped.You're swinging on the top.Suspended there with him.And he's the darling of the sheik.The flavor of the week is melting.Down your pretty summer dress.Baby, what a mess you're making..I've been stumbling through some dark places.Now I'm following the plow.I know I've fallen out of your good graces.It's alright now.And I've been waiting in the weeds.Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the.Wild birds scattering the seeds.Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune.The phases of the moon.The chambers of the heart.The ebb and dart of small gray.Spiders spinning in the dark.In spite of all the times the web is torn apart.And I've been waiting in the weeds.Waiting for the time to come around again and.Hope is floating on the breeze.Carrying my soul high up above the ground and.I've been keeping to myself.Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing you.And though you're with somebody else.He'll never love you like I do.

Starry, starry night.Paint your palette blue and grey.Look out on a summer's day.With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.Shadows on the hills.Sketch the trees and the daffodils.Catch the breeze and the winter chills.In colors on the snowy linen land.Now I understand.What you tried to say to me.And how you suffered for your sanity.And how you tried to set them free.They would not listen, they did not know how.Perhaps they'll listen now.Starry, starry night.Flaming flowers that brightly blaze.Swirling clouds in a violet haze.Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue.Colors changing hue.Morning fields of amber grain.Weathered faces lined in pain.Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.Now I understand.What you tried to say to me.How you suffered for your sanity.How you tried to set them free.They would not listen, they did not know how.Perhaps they'll listen now.For they could not love you.But still your love was true.And when no hope was left in sight.On that starry, starry night.You took your life, as lovers often do.But I could've told you, Vincent.This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.Starry, starry night.Portraits hung in empty halls.Frameless heads on nameless walls.With eyes that watch the world and can't forget.Like the strangers that you've met.The ragged men in ragged clothes.The silver thorn on the bloody rose.Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.Now I think I know.What you tried to say to me.And how you suffered for your sanity.And how you tried to set them free.They would not listen, they're not listening still.Perhaps they never will.

31654246-Take Me to Church (Hozier Cover):::.My lover's got humor.She's the giggle at a funeral.Knows everybody's disapproval.I should've worshiped her sooner.If the Heavens ever did speak.She's the last true mouth piece.Every Sunday's getting more bleak.A fresh poison each week.We were born sick, you heard them say it.My church offers no absolutes.She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'..The only heaven I'll be sent to.Is when I'm alone with you.I was born sick, but I love it.Command me to be well.Amen. Amen. Amen.Take me to church.I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your life.I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.Offer me that deathless heaven.Good god, let me give you my life.Take me to church.I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.Offer me that deathless death.Good god, let me give you my life.If I'm a pagan of the good times.My lover's the sunlight.To keep the goddess on my side.She demands a sacrifice.To drain the whole sea.Get something shiny.Something meaty for the main course.That's a fine looking high horse.What you got in the stable?.We've a lot of starving faithful.That looks tasty.That looks plenty.This is hungry work.Take me to church.I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife.Offer me my deathless death.Good god, let me give you my life.Take me to church.I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife.Offer me my deathless death.Good god, let me give you my life.No masters or kings when the ritual begins.There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin.In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene.Only then I am human.Only then I am clean.Amen. Amen. Amen.Take me to church.I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.Offer me that deathless death.Good god, let me give you my life.Take me to church.I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies.I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.Offer me that deathless death.Good god, let me give you my life.

19182328-Sailboats:::Sailboats wish that they were stars.Floating softly in the sky.Among our dreams that bid goodbye.Moving through transparent space.Drifting through the stratosphere.And onward 'till they disappear.These continents' from overhead.Look like tiny paper shapes.Intricately set in place.Below the misty mountain clouds.There's a lovely silver bay.Where sunset sailors often hide away.Scuba diver in the lock.Speedboat driver on the dock.Sailplane pilot in the blue' take me up there with you.The world looks brighter from this high altitude.I was walking through the trees.（Sailboats wish that they were stars）.And I was swimming through the sees.（'Cause they don't know who they are）.I was falling through the air.When it hit me right there.My eyes are tired.I don't even care.An airplane carred me to bed.Where I slept above the coast.and dreamt I had become a ghost.I sail above the frozen peaks.Deep in cold cathedral caves.Across the hills and far beyond the waves.Take the car on the run.Fly the jet to the sun.And bring the spacecraft in soon.While I play chess with the moon.I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon.Once in 1964.Sailboats wish that they were stars.An actress ran on the shore.Cause they don't know who they are.And though you'll never return.I love you' Audrey Hepburn.Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd.There are sailboats throughout this brilliant sky.But you cannot pick them out if you can't fly.I'm glad the Earth doesn't care If I go up there.If you want to' just ask me and I'll take you along.

4425889-A Lovely Wedding - Snow and Sky:::Ladies and Gentlemen,.I‘d planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans..Today is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger..We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss..Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground..But, we‘ve never lost an astronaut in flight. We‘ve never had a tragedy like this..And perhaps we‘ve forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle..But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly..We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe..We mourn their loss as a nation together..For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy..But we feel the loss, and we‘re thinking about you so very much..Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, “Give me a challenge, and I‘ll meet it with joy.”.They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us..We‘ve grown used to wonders in this century..It‘s hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program has been doing just that..We‘ve grown used to the idea of space, and, perhaps we forget that we‘ve only just begun..We‘re still pioneers..They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers..And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle‘s take-off..I know it‘s hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen..It‘s all part of the process of exploration and discovery..It‘s all part of taking a chance and expanding man‘s horizons..The future doesn‘t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave..The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we‘ll continue to follow them..I‘ve always had great faith in and respect for our space program..And what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don‘t hide our space program..We don‘t keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public..That‘s the way freedom is, and we wouldn‘t change it for a minute..We‘ll continue our quest in space..There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space..Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue..I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA, or who worked on this mission and tell them:. “Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.”.There‘s a coincidence today..On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian later said,.“He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.” Well, today, we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake‘s, complete..The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives..We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and “slipped the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”.Thank you..

I've learned to slam on the brake.Before I even turn the key.Before I make the mistake.Before I lead with the worst of me.Give them no reason to stare.No slipping up if you slip away.So I got nothing to share.No, I got nothing to say.Step out, step out of the sun.If you keep getting burned.Step out, step out of the sun.Because you've learned, because you've learned.On the outside, always looking in.Will I ever be more than I've always been?.'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass.I'm waving through a window.I try to speak, but nobody can hear.So I wait around for an answer to appear.While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass.I'm waving through a window, oh.Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?.We start with stars in our eyes.We start believing that we belong.But every sun doesn't rise.And no one tells you where you went wrong.Step out, step out of the sun.If you keep getting burned.Step out, step out of the sun.Because you've learned, because you've learned.On the outside, always looking in.Will I ever be more than I've always been?.'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass.Waving through a window.I try to speak, but nobody can hear.So I wait around for an answer to appear.While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass.Waving through a window, oh.Can anybody see, is anybody waving?.When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around.Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?.When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around.Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?.When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around.Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?.When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around.Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?.Did I even make a sound?.Did I even make a sound?.It's like I never made a sound.Will I ever make a sound?.On the outside, always looking in.Will I ever be more than I've always been?.'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass.Waving through a window.I try to speak, but nobody can hear.So I wait around for an answer to appear.While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass.Waving through a window, oh.Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?.Is anybody waving?.Waving, waving.whoa-oh. whoa-oh-oh-oh.

17706496-Fuzzy Blue Lights:::If I could look acros s the country.From California to New Jersey.Then I would count the parks and lake resorts.And number all the jets and airports.All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me.Cuz I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see.If I could open up my window.And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau.Then I would survey all those open miles.And line them up in single file.Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime.And all those oceanic vistas are so divine.If I was standing on the balcony.And you were walking down below.I’d feel rather depressed and out of place.And lonely just to watch you go.If you were swinging from the highway overpass.Within the western hemisphere.I’d feel rather afraid and insincere.If you began to disappear.If I was walking through a sad art gallery.And you were driving through the night.I’d feel rather alone and ill at ease.Beneath the brilliant showroom light.If I was flying on a plane above your town.And you were gazing at the sky.Somehow I’d feel intact and reassured.If you began to wave goodbye.
28727863-This Isn't the End:::An 8 year old girl had a panic attack.Cause the father she loved left and never looked back.No longer the hero she counted on.He told her he loved her and then he was gone.She tried to look happy in front her friends.But knew that she’d never feel normal again.She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes.And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye.When the rain falls down.When it all turns around.When the light goes out this isn’t the end.Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked.But nobody knew he was dying inside.He promised his family he’d be all right.And then with a gunshot he left them behind.When the rain falls down.When it all turns around.When the light goes out this isn’t the end.When the rain falls down.When it all turns around.When the light goes out this isn’t the end. (Nooo-oh).A role of a father he never deserved.He abandoned his daughter, and never returned.And over the years though the pain was real.She finally forgave him, and started to heal.How close to the ending? Well, nobody knows.The future’s a mystery and anything goes.Love is confusing and life is hard.You fight to survive cause you made it this far.It’s all too astounding to comprehend.It’s just the beginning this isn’t the end.It’s just the beginning this isn’t the end...

5190225-Where Is the Love?:::What's wrong with the world, mama?.People livin' like they ain't got no mamas.I think the whole world's addicted to the drama.Only attracted to the things that'll bring the trauma.Overseas ya we tryin' to stop terrorism.But we still got terrorists here livin'.In the U.S.A, the big C.I.A.The bloods and the crips, and the KKK.But if you only got love for your own ways.Then you only leave space to discriminate.To discriminate only generates hate.And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate.Madness is what you demonstrate.And that's exactly how anger works and operates.Man ya gotta have love, this'll set us straight.Take control of your mind and meditate.Let your soul gravitate, to the love ya'll..People killin'.People dyin'.Children hurt and you hear them crying.Will you practice what you preach.Or would you turn the other cheek.Father father father, help us.Send some guidance from above.These people got me got me questionin'.Where is the love?(love).Where is the love?(the love).Where is the love?(the love).Where is the love, the love, my love.it just ain't the same.old ways have changed.new days are strange, is world insane?.if love and peace is so strong.why are there pieces of love that don't belong.nations droppin' bombs.chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones.with ongoin' sufferin', as the youth die young.so ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone.so I can ask myself, really what is going wrong.with this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in.makin wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends.not respectin' each other, deny thy brother.a war is goin' on but the reason's under cover.the truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug.if you never know truth, then you never know love.where's the love ya'll? (i don't know).where's the truth ya'll? (i don't know).and where's the love ya'll?.People killin'.People dyin'.Children hurt and you hear them cryin'.Will you practice what you preach.Or would you turn the other cheek.Father father father, help us.Send some guidance from above.These people got me got me questionin.Where is the love?(love).Where is the love?(the love).Where is the love?(the love).Where is the love, the love, my love.I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder.as I'm getting older, ya'll people gets colder.most of us only care about money makin'.selfishness got us followin the wrong direction.wrong information always shown by the media.negative images is the main criteria.infecting the young minds faster than bacteria.kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema.whatever happened to the values of humanity?.whatever happened to the fairness and equality.instead of spreading love we spreadin' animosity.lack of understandin' leading us away from unity.that's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under.that's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down.It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under.gotta keep my faith alive till love is found.now ask yourself.People killin'.People dyin'.Children hurt and you hear them crying.Will you practice what you preach.Or would you turn the other cheek.Father father father, help us.Send some guidance from above.These people got me got me questionin'.Where is the love?(love).Where is the love?(the love).Where is the love?(the love).Where is the love, the love, my love.

Castles glitter under Spanish skies.But I'm just looking out for you tonight..We used to run around this ghost town.Always thinking out loud.Are we gonna get out?.I remember.We dream of places that we could go.Castles with the strange glow.People that we don't know.I remember..We left a life.That's ordinary from the start.We looked for stranger things.Cause that's just who we are.Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud.Like I'm picturing now..Castles glitter under Spanish skies.But I'm just looking out for you tonight.Snow white mountains in a foreign state.Tell me someday we'll get there.Someday.Someday..I see a Technicolor shadow.Underneath your window.Just in case you don't know.I can see it.You cast an unfamiliar day glow.Different than what I know.Shining like a halo.I can feel it..We turned our back on ordinary from the start.We looked for stranger things.Cause that's just who we are.Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud.Show me the sky falling down..Castles glitter under Spanish skies.But I'm just looking out for you tonight.Snow white mountains in an ancient place.Tell me someday we'll get together.Someday.Someday..Castles glitter under Spanish skies.But I'm just looking out for you tonight.Snow white mountains in an ancient place.Tell me someday we'll get together..

16509522-Both Of Us:::I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us.Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us.Ever thought about losing it.When your money's all gone and you lose your whip.You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you do for rent.And the grass so green on the other side.Make a n-gga wanna run staight through the fence.We're never freezed by two hundred times.But still can't find no food in it.That's foolishness.And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look, and the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought, how much that cost?.Cause it even really matter?.Cause the flight is a uphill battle.But y'all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder.In the same boat, with the same ol' battle.Why so shallow? I'm just asking.What's the pattern setting madness.Everybody ain't a number one draft pick.Most of us ain't hollywood actors.But if it's all for one, and one for all.Then maybe one day, we all can rock.Do it one time for the underdogs.Sincerely yours, from one of yours.I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us.Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us.I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle.You just wanna live, been levitating so low.That you could drown in a bubble.That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up.For all the times no one's ever spoke for us.To every single time that they play this song.You can say that that's what bobby ray wrote for us.When the tides get too high.And the sea upon your knees get so deep.And you feel like you're just another person.Getting lost in the crowd, where your partner, no please.Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us.But we still stand tall with our shoulders up.And even though we always a chance to us.These are the things that've molded us.And if life hadn't chosen us.Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up.Cause if it was up to me, i'd make a new blueprint.Feel better from the ground up, hey.But if it's all for one, and one for all.Then maybe one day, we all can rock.Do it one time for the underdogs.From bobby ray, to all of y'all.I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us.Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us.

28665554-Don't:::Ah lahmlahlah.I met this girl late last year.She said don't you worry if I disappear.I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake.I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait.But then I jump right in.A week later return.I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn.But I gave her my time for two or three nights.Then I put it on pause until the moment was right.I went away for months until our paths crossed again.She told me I was never looking for a friend.Maybe you could swing by my room around 10.Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM.Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said.She's singing.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.That heart is so cold.All over my arm.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.I told her she knows.Take aim and reload.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.For a couple weeks I.Only want to see her.We drink away the days with a take away pizza.Before a text message was the only way to reach her.Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her.Singing out Aretha.All over the track like a feature.Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either.But me and her we make money the same way.Four cities, two planes the same day.Those shows have never been what it's about.But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out.I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch.But we should get on a plane.Or we'll be missing it now.Wish I'd have written it down.The way that things played out.When she was kissing him.How? I was confused about.She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.That heart is so cold.All over my arm.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.I told her she knows.Take aim and reload.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.on my hotel door.I don't even know if she knows what for.She was crying on my shoulder.I already told ya.Trust and respect is what we do this for.I never intended to be next.But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all.And I never saw him as a threat.Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course.It's not like we were both on tour.We were staying on the same ****ing hotel floor.And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment.But it was never just fun and I thought you were different.This is not the way you realize what you wanted.It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest.All this time God knows I'm singing.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.That heart is so cold.All over my arm.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.I told her she knows.Take aim and reload.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.That heart is so cold.All over my arm.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.Don't **** with my love.I told her she knows.Take aim and reload.I don't wanna know that babe.Ah lahmlahlah.

451701104-Castle on the Hill:::.When I was six years old.I broke my leg.And I was running from my brother and his friends.And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down.I was younger then.Take me back to when.I found my heart and broke it here.Made my friends and lost them through the years.And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long.I know I've grown.I can't wait to go home.I'm on my way.Driving at 90 down those.Country lanes.Singing to Tiny Dancer.And I miss the way you made me feel.It's real, we watched the sunset.Over the castle on the hill..Fifteen years old.And smoking hand-rolled cigarettes.Running from the law through the backfields.And getting drunk with my friends.Had my first kiss on a Friday night.I don't reckon that I did it right.But I was younger then.Take me back to when.We found weekend jobs, when we got paid.We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight.Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long.Oh, how we've grown.I can't wait to go home.I'm on my way.Driving at 90 down those.Country lanes.Singing to Tiny Dancer.And I miss the way you made me feel.It's real, we watched the sunset.Over the castle on the hill.Over the castle on the hill.Over the castle on the hill..One friend left to sell clothes.One works down by the coast.One had two kids but lives alone.One's brother overdosed.One's already on his second wife.One's just barely getting by.But these people raised me.And I can't wait to go home.And I'm on my way.I still remember these old.Country lanes.When we did not know the answers.And I miss the way you made me feel.It's real, we watched the sunset.Over the castle on the hill.Over the castle on the hill.Over the castle on the hill..

My Name Is''dropped.Started thinking my name was fall.Cause anytime things went wrong.I was the one who they would blame it on.The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Kahn.Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg.Gangsta? Naw, courageous ***********.Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft.And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws.And the thing's been out since then.But up until the instant that I've been against it.It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a ***********tstain I thought.No wonder I had to unlearn everything that my brain was taught.Do I really belong in this game? I pondered.I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?.So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on.And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon.But sometimes you gotta take a loss.And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off.And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet.And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it.Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah.Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times.How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?.What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?.Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are,.when I was afraid to….Afraid to make a single sound.Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out.Afraid I never before.I didn't wanna go another round.An angry man's power will shut you up.Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love.Run out of excuses with every word.So here I am and I will not run.Guts over fear, the time is here.Guts over fear, I shall not tear.For all the times I let you push me around and push me down.Guts over fear, guts over fear..Feels like a close, it's coming to.*********** am I gonna do?.It's too late to start over.This is the only thing I, thing I know.It's like I was there once, single parents.Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?.And the pain spawns all the anger on.But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on.That I made a spark, started to spit hard as ***********t.Learned how to harness it while the reins were off.And there was a lot of bizarre ***********t, but the crazy part.Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a ***********".Haters started to appreciate my art.And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused.But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?.The lights go out in the trailer park.And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in.And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from.Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun.So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song.But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than another *********in' "We Made You" uh.Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs.My demise and my uprise, pray to God.I just opened enough eyes later on.Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong.And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt.Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt.Just having to balance my damn self.Those dang eggshells, I was made to walk.But thank you ma, 'cause that gave me the.Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium.At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done.So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day they would just get accepted.I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason I made this song.Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more.From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk.Take it with a grain of salt and eat their ********* faces off.The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone.And to think I was....Afraid to make a single sound.Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out.Afraid I never before.I didn't wanna go another round.An angry man's power will shut you up.Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love.Run out of excuses with every word.So here I am and I will not run.Guts over fear, the time is here.Guts over fear, I shall not tear.For all the times I let you push me around and push me down.Guts over fear, guts over fear.
